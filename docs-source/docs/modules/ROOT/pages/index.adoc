:description: Guided documentation of Akka for specific use cases

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

Welcome to the _Akka Platform Guide_!

Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications.

Both beginners getting started with _Reactive_ principles and active Akka users will find this guide useful to improve their understanding of how Akka fits into _Reactive_ and how Reactive concepts apply to Akka. The guide complements the {akka}[Akka reference documentation {tab-icon}, window="tab"], which presents all Akka features in detail.

The tutorials in this guide show end-to-end use-cases implemented in Akka with the Reactive principles in mind. The tutorials go through implementing a system step-by-step to illustrate how the Akka APIs apply together.

== How to get the most out of this guide

For a code-first experience, have a look at the xref:microservices-tutorial:index.adoc[Implementing Microservices with Akka tutorial] which walks you through an example project and explains how features from the Akka ecosystem fit together to build Reactive Systems. The tutorial will point you to the relevant xref:concepts:index.adoc[concepts] where applicable.

If this is your first experience with Reactive frameworks or with Akka, we present some background and ideas behind _Reactive_ in the xref:concepts:index.adoc[Concepts section]. You can read those when they are introduced in the tutorial, or read them first if you prefer a more theoretical overview before diving into the code. There you will learn for example:

* The challenges that Reactive Architecture can help you overcome
* A summary of Reactive Principles
* The benefits of using Akka

== Akka Microservices tutorial

The xref:microservices-tutorial:index.adoc[Implementing Microservices with Akka tutorial] illustrates how to implement an Event Sourced CQRS application with Akka Persistence and Akka Projections.

The tutorial shows how to build the services piece by piece:

== How to...

Some development tasks arise from requirements on existing projects. The xref:how-to:index.adoc[] section collects guidance for how to introduce a new feature or architectural improvement on an existing codebase.
